## Morning Burrito - mobile app for creatives
This was my final group project at Le Wagon. Primarily a mobile app, it is an app in the style of Duolingo where instead of daily language lessons, you do activities that are meant to inspire creativity; for example, writing a haiku based on a prompt or drawing a picture based on recordings of some sounds outside. 

## Goals
- To create a full-stack application from conception to finished product.
- Work as a team, learning about and utilizing software engineering best practices and working in an agile way.
  
## Teammates

## Reflections
I learnt a lot about working as a team. My teammates were fantastic, and from the start clear communication was prioritised. We all had different strengths, but were equally happy to challenge ourselves also. This project reinforced for me the importance of:
- the planning and designing stage. Had we simply dived into building the app with only a vague idea of what the finished product would look like, it would not have worked. [Joanne](https://github.com/Andrejo42) created a fantastic figma design that aided us massively when working on the frontend. 
- regular pull requests, and reviewing these together.
- working on features a little at a time, so that code reviews were more focused.
- working side-by-side, to facilitate asking questions; when working remotely, going into breakout rooms to discuss and review code.
- daily stand-ups, so that everyone knew what the others were working on.

On a more personal note, I improved my JavaScript skills a lot. I really enjoyed using JS to make certain features more user-focused with smooth animations and interactivity. This is something I now strive to include in every project. 

There were some things I found less intuitive. I got into circles trying to figure out some of the Active Record (database) features and how they communicated with the frontend, for example on the dashboard page. Working with my teammates, particularly [Alex](https://github.com/alexandertan527), helped me with this and I found the process of discussing the problem hugely beneficial. Active Record and databases in general is something I am focusing on in my self-directed projects. 

## Future Additions
As this was a project completed in the span of about 7/8 days, we focused on completing Morning Burrito as more of an MVP (minimum viable product). As a result, it is not responsively designed and some of the features are not fully working yet. A priority would be to ensure it is responsive and can be used as a desktop app.
